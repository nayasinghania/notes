== Relevance

/ Positive Relevance : A statement that counts in favor to another statement

/ Negative Relevance : A statement that counts against another statement

/ Logical Irrelevance : A statement that counts neither for or against another statement

== Fallacies of Relevance
=== #def
Mistakes in reasoning that occur because the premises are logically irrelevant to the conclusion

/ Personal Attack (Ad Hominem) : Rejecting someone's argument or claim by attacking the other person rather than the person's argument or claim

/ Attacking the Motive : The error of criticizing a person’s motivation for offering a particular argument or claim, rather than examining the worth of the argument or claim itself

/ Look Who's Talking (Tu Quoque) : An arguer rejects another person’s argument or claim because that person fails to practice what he preaches

/ Two Wrongs Make a Right : When an arguer attempts to justify a wrongful act by claiming that some other act is just as bad or worse

/ Scare Tactics : When an arguer threatens harm to a reader or listener if he or she does not accept the arguer’s conclusion and this threat is irrelevant to the truth of the arguer’s conclusion

/ Appeal to Pity : When an arguer inappropriately attempts to evoke feelings of pity or compassion from his listeners or readers

/ Bandwagon Argument : Plays on a person’s desire to be popular, accepted, or valued, rather than appealing to logically relevant reasons or evidence

/ Straw Man : When an arguer distorts an opponent’s argument or claim to make it easier to attack

/ Red Herring : When an arguer tries to sidetrack his audience by raising an irrelevant issue and then claims that the original issue has effectively been settled by the irrelevant diversion

/ Equivocation : When a key word is used in two or more senses in the same argument and the apparent success of the argument depends on the shift in meaning

/ Begging the Question : When an arguer states or assumes as a premise the very thing he or she is trying to prove as a conclusion

== Fallacies of Insufficient Evidence

=== #def
Mistakes in reasoning that occur because the premises, though logically relevant to the conclusion, fail to provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.

/ Inappropriate Appeal to Authority : When an arguer cites a witness or authority who, there is good reason to believe, is unreliable.
- Is the source not an authority on the subject at issue?
- Is the source biased?
- Is the accuracy of the source’s observations questionable?
- Is the source known to be generally unreliable?
- Has the source been cited incorrectly?
- Does the source’s claim conflict with expert opinion?
- Is the source’s claim not one that can be settled by an appeal to expert opinion?
- Is the claim highly improbable on its face?

/ Appeal to Ignorance : When an arguer asserts that a claim must be true because no one has proven it false or, conversely, that a claim must be false because no one has proven it true.

/ False Alternatives : When an arguer poses a false either/or choice.

/ Loaded Question : When an arguer asks a question that contains an unfair or unwarranted presupposition.

/ Questionable Cause : When an arguer claims, without sufficient evidence, that one thing is the cause of something else.

/ Post Hoc Fallacy : When an arguer assumes, without adequate evidence, that because one event, A, occurred before another event, B, A is the cause of B.

/ Mere Correlation Fallacy : When an arguer assumes, without sufficient evidence, that because A and B regularly occur together, A must be the cause of B or vice versa.

/ Oversimplified Cause Fallacy : When we assume, without adequate evidence, that A is the sole cause of B when, in fact, there are several causes of B.

/ Hasty Generalization : When we draw a general conclusion from a sample that is biased or too small.

/ Slippery Slope : When we claim, without sufficient evidence, that a seemingly harmless action, if taken, will lead to a disastrous outcome.

/ Weak Analogy : When an arguer compares two (or more) things that aren’t really comparable in relevant respects.

/ Inconsistency : When an arguer asserts inconsistent or contradictory claims.
